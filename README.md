# ESCAPE

Utilizing NUS's  [Kelvin Sung](https://github.com/Apress/build-your-own-2d-game-engine/tree/master/V2-EngineWithPhysics%2BParticles/DemoWithPhysics%2BParticle)'s 2D game physics engine, based on web-gl, it is a 2D horizontal version of the game.

## Operate

* W : jump
* A ：move left
* D ：move right
* Space : pick up game items and pass the level
* K : (if you have the nets) set the track to kill the zombie
* L : (if you have the gun and have bullets) shoot bullets to kill zombies

### Now

 It is still developing now, and it is only developed for 3 days,  so there are many bugs here. If you like the game , it's our pleasure to accept your suggestions.
